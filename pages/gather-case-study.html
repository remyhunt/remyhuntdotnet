          <h1>Case Study: <span class="title">Gather</span> – a micro-library of art + design books</h1>
          <div class="blog-header-text">
            <p> 2.2.20 — Inspired by my dissent towards the inhospitable public spaces and lack of room for collaboration on campus at UMass Boston, I sought to investigate the idea of creating a library of art and design materials for students to use.
            </br></br>
              Using only my department-assigned locker, I curated a small library of art and design books and materials for public access.

          <h3>01. Ideation - a public space problem</h3>
          <p>This library came to life as an intervention – a reclaiming of the underutilized public space of the halls of the art department.
            In what I believe to be a space for inspiration and collaboration, the lack of accomodating space to sit and converse was very upsetting to me.
            <br><br>
            I considered what space I could occupy witout getting into too much trouble - and luckily I had a locker assigned in a fairly high-traffic location!

          <h3>02. What Makes A Library? </h3>
          <p>
            There were two major challenges that I faced in this project. The first being books - as in, where do I get the books from?
            <br><br>
            Part of the inspiration for Gather was a lack of design resources, so naturally, I didn't have access to many texts. To solve this, I scoured the local public libraries and put piles of books on reserve and lugged them over to my library.

            <br>
            <br>
            This exercise in itself was useful - I discovered new titles that I hadn't heard of! Gather became a sort of library of libraries. 
            <br><br>
            The second major challenge was to create a borrowing system. To keep track of books I created a finite number of plastic tags (below), which were in a bin affixed to the interior of the locker. In addition to that, I created signage 
            which suggested the materials were for in-department use only. This was a compromise to the ethos of the project but felt necessary.
            <br><br>
             In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have risked my Cambridge Public Library card, but after all, this was an intervention!

          <h3>03. More Than Just Books – the visual language and aesthetics of libraries</h3>
          <p>In order to investigate what visually signals that something is a library, I did some research and ultimately created a <a href="https://www.are.na/remy-hunter/little-libraries">mood board of micro-libraries</a> from 
            which I borrowed some of the concepts, such as the spine labels and borrowing tags.
